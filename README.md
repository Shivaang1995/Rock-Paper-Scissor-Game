# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game

This Project is a rock paper scissor game. I have used three servo motors interfaced with ultrasonic sensor and buzzer and led. microcontroller I used is Arduino Nano. Whenver you put your hand in front of Arduino Uno , any servvo motor will randomly move Upward at a time. So it will act like you are playing rock, paper and  Scissor game with the setup.
